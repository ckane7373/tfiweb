            Ghana, located in the Gulf of Guinea, truly lays claim to the title “Centre of the
            world” as its latitude and longitude are the closest landmass to the intersection of
            the equator and the Greenwich Meridian. Ghana recently became the host nation
            for the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. The Country’s
            traditional exports are gold, oil, diamond, bauxite, manganese, cocoa, and timber.
            The nation of 30 million inhabitants has an average age of 21 years, a literacy rate
            of 75% and a GDP equivalent to US$75 billion. The per capita income is US$2500.
            Ghana is a multi-party electoral state with an Executive and Legislative branch and
            an independent Judiciary.

            The Director of Ten Forward International Group is a pioneering international
            entrepreneur with decades of experience across different sectors of the economy.
            He started his career as an investment banker in Hong Kong and Singapore upon
            graduating in 1992 with dual degrees in Economics and International Relations
            from Tufts University, in Boston. After working for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong
            and then IDEA Advisory Partners in Singapore, he was posted to Japan to establish
            the Tokyo branch office. After successfully establishing the Tokyo Office, Nana
            identified a unique opportunity to utilize technology to provide a gateway for
            money managers to trade electronically on the Japanese financial markets, and to
            hedge their delta positions. After 3 years of operations, Global Netrade Securities
            Limited was acquired by Shinsei Bank, a portfolio company of Ripplewood
            Holdings LLC, and became part of Shinsei Securities Limited.
            Ten Forward International Japan Limited was established in 2002 to facilitate
            exports of value-added goods from Africa to the Asian markets. The company
            initially produced and exported industrial chocolates and alcoholic beverages
            which had limited success, but the breakthrough products were shea butter based
            cosmetic brands called “Mama Butter” and “Dagomba Shea” that came to be sold in
            over 5000 shops across Japan. In 2004, Nana acquired the exclusive Japan license
            for the ISOMAX Terra-Sol Energy Building Technology, an innovative German
            building system that drastically reduced the maintenance cost of the building’s
            lifecycle. ISOMAX Holdings Japan Limited integrated the technology into several
            structures in Japan including public and private buildings. Since 2010 Nana Kofi
            Sarfo Prempeh has been investing in developing infrastructure projects in Africa in
            areas of Power Generation, Minerals Exploration and Agriculture Development.
            Nana Kofi Sarfo Prempeh is a member of the Asante Royal Family and a Chief in
            the Asante Kingdom of Ghana. He is a descendant of a family that has played
            prominent roles in the affairs of the State since the pre-colonial period until now.
